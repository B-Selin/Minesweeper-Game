# Minesweeper-Game
Remake of FreecodeCamp Object Oriented Programming with Python – Code a Minesweeper Game


This exercise is based on the tutorial of FreeCodeCamp Object Oriented Programming with Python – Code a Minesweeper Game.
My additions would be 
  - if surrounding cells of a free cell (meaning a cell that has 0 mines around) also has a free cell, show those too
  - when game ended, give option to restart
